Self made visualization showing how Avalanche's consensus protocol can quickly reach network agreement

I coded a Processing visualization to help you (and myself) to understand how Avalanche's random sampling can quickly reach network consensus. The hypothetical network contains 10k nodes (represented by dots). Each node started with a randomly chosen stance (red/white), and after several rounds of sampling, the network swings to one side (like an avalanche). You can see how the process is the most dramatic when it jumped from 60% to 90%. The parameters are not entirely loyal to Ava Lab's values. It's just a demo after all.
